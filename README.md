## 1. Extract Links
**Main Goal:** Extract site and then relevant links from a local site.

- **Site Sucker:**  
  - Extract site ready to get links.
  - Easier.
  - CDN come with.
  - Less data loss.
  - May cause problems (e.g., Cloudflare or Arvan Cloud).
  - Larger data.

- **Crawling:**  
  - Create links.
  - More customizable.
  - Less extra data.
  - Incomplete code.
  - No CDN.
  - More accessible.

**ToDo:**
- Check Sitemap Extraction. Consider extracting links from sitemaps if available. This can provide a complete list of URLs without exhaustive crawling.

**Status:** Created ‚úîÔ∏è  
**Output:** `Links.txt`

## 2. Check Links
**Main Goal:** Validate extracted links.

- Check no comment page.
- Check no category page.
- Validate links.
- Ensure same structure.
- Ability to retrieve text and data for the next step.

**Future:**  
Develop a code to check the HTML structure of each link. Validate structures and save valid ones.

**Tips:**  
- Uniformity Check: Ensure the URLs are normalized, meaning they are presented in a standard format, to prevent processing duplicate URLs.
- Manual review of final results is recommended.

**Status:** Not created || Need code üîß  
**ToDo:** Create file and logic.  
**Output:** `Links.txt`

## 3. Read Links and Create JSON
**Main Goal:** Scrape data from validated links and store in JSON.

- Class names vary between websites; ensure accuracy.
- Implement a validation function for each page's results.

**Problems and ToDo list:**  
[List of considerations and challenges, e.g., JSON structure and handling specifics, validation requirements, etc.]

**Tips:**  
- Redirection Handling: Ensure the system can handle redirects and log instances for review to avoid missing data.

**Status:** Need update üîß  
**Output:** `Extracted.json`

## 4. Translation
**Main Goal:** Translate extracted text/data.

[Details and considerations related to translation]

**Status:** Might need update üîß  
**Output:** `translated.json`

## 5. Combine CDN with Translated JSON
**Main Goal:** Combine translated text and CDN-based media.

[Details and considerations for this phase]

**Status:** Not created || Need code üîß || Need to check with ALI & SALEH  
**Output:** `UPdated_translate.json(link)`

## 6. HTML Formatting
**Main Goal:** Merge HTML tags and media content.

**Tips:**  
- Special Character Handling: Ensure that special characters and multiline strings are handled appropriately.

## 7. Convert JSON to CSV
**Main Goal:** Convert data to a CSV format (if required).

[Considerations about potentially finding a plugin to bypass this step.]

## 8. Data Import and Use
API Endpoint considerations and data update handling specifics.

## 9. Monitoring and Maintenance
Details about setting up monitoring, periodic auditing, and error alerts.

## 10. Review and Refinement
Details about feedback loops, periodic reviews, and the importance of continuous improvement.

**Note:** Each project is unique. This roadmap might need specific adjustments tailored to the challenges and requirements of your endeavor.
